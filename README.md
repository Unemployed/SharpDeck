# SharpDeck
C# Library for a generic deck of cards

This is still a work in progress, so use at your own risk.

Current functionalty includes:
- Jokers
- Shuffling
- Translating card codes 'AS' into full name 'Ace of Spades'

Known problems
- The Card constructor does not set the Suit property when just a cardcode is passed in
